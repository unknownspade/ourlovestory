            <p>Dear Bubba,</p>
            <p>
                I want to start this letter by letting you know how incredibly thankful I am for everything you do for me. Every little thing you do, from the way you support me during my tough moments to the times you make me smile when I need it most, means the world to me. You make my life so much brighter, and I feel so blessed to have you by my side. I know there are times when I can be stubborn or hard to understand, and I may not always express myself the way I should. But please know, deep down, I appreciate you more than words can say.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are my rock, my safe place, and the person I want to share all my tomorrows with. No matter what challenges come our way, I want you to know that I will always stand by your side. I may not be perfect, but my commitment to you is unwavering. I will never leave you, because this is our endgame, our forever. You've captured my heart in a way that no one else ever has, and I’m determined to love you through every season of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love you so deeply that I would do anything to protect you, even if it means taking a bullet for you, just to ensure that you live. Your happiness and well-being mean everything to me, and I would sacrifice anything to keep you safe. I'm truly sorry for any stress or frustration I may have caused you, and I hope you can forgive me for the moments where I fell short. I want you to remember that even when I’m difficult or imperfect, I am still the man who loves you more than life itself. I am still the man you said yes to, the one you trusted with your heart, and I don’t take that lightly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope, with all my heart, that you continue to be vulnerable with me, to open up and share everything with me. I want you to feel safe and comfortable in my arms, knowing that I will always be here to listen, to comfort, and to love you through it all. There’s no need to ever hold back or hide your emotions from me. I want to be the one you turn to in your darkest hours, the one who lifts you up and makes you feel loved, cherished, and understood.
            </p>
            <p>You are my everything, bubba, and I love you more than words can express. No matter what happens, I will always choose you. My heart is yours, now and forever.</p>
            <p>I love you so much, Bubba! Forever yours,</p>
